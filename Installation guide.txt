1. Install "Alias Isolation". The latest version can be found on GitHub. 

Good news! You no longer have to worry about launching Alien: Isolation via the GUI.

Alias is now available as a dll, meaning it is automatically injected into the game.

2. For Nvidia users, this may not work alone. Head to your Nvidia control panel, hit Program Features and Add Alien: Isolation.
   
   Then scroll down to toggle Multi-Frame Sample AA (MFAA) on.

3. Copy-paste the contents of my folder; "Alien Isolation" atop your existing game folder to overwrite the default Reshade and the game's DATA folder.

_____________________

4. Install the lastest Reshade to the location of your AI.exe.

   For Steam users, it's likely C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Alien Isolation

   I'm currently running on 6.5.1. It will prompt you to "Choose a preset file (.ini)".

   Hit Browse and find "FimicNoirReshade1.5.ini" in the Alien Isolation folder.

5. Now for ray tracing. The game's global illumination system is wonderful, but to add that little extra shadow depth and light bounce,
   
   we can grab the RTGI shader created by Pascal Gilcher.

   It's a paid shader as part of the iMMERSE Pro pack, available through Gilcher's Patreon. One month's subscription will gain you access.

  a)  Extract the iMMERSE Pro pack to a safe place.

  b)  Copy the Textures folder therein and paste it to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Alien Isolation\reshade-shaders

  c)  Drop the contents of the Shaders folder into C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Alien Isolation\reshade-Shaders\Shaders\iMMERSE

      IF YOU WOULD RATHER NOT SPEND MONEY, don't worry, I got you.

      NOIR 1.5 Kino (provided in my pack) is good for 80% of the game, and benefits from no ghosting during cutscenes - what it was made for.

6. Finally, you can load up Alien Isolation. In the Video settings, switch to Windowed Fullscreen, Motion Blur On and Chromatic Aberration Off.

   Make sure Anti-aliasing is set to SMAA T1x, then you're good to go!

BUT WAIT? What's that optional folder?

For the following steps, I have original back up files in the folder entitled, "BACKUP", just in case.

_____________________


First, we have LENSFLARECONFIG.BIN. 

This removes certain lens flare elements one would expect from anamorphic lenses/ coated lenses.

Black and white films were often filmed with spherical lenses, in a 1.85:1 aspect ratio.

Lens flare isn't so glaring with spherical; you get lateral bloom instead,

much like what you see when looking at individual lights across Sevastopol Station.

Just pop that LENSFLARE_CONFIG.BIN into your DATA folder.

_____________________


Now for the mysterious UI.BNK. The copy I created for this pack has removed that high pitched sound effect for save stations.

That sound alone does a fabulous job of triggering tinnitus in sufferers, so the option is there should you wish to use it.

In Alien Isolation\DATA\SOUND you will find the original UI.BNK file.

Simply replace it with the version in this pack.

Deleting it entirely removes 250 other sound effects, which is not ideal.

_____________________

If you want to delete the immersion-breaking orange glow every interactive aspect of the game has,

SELECTIONOVERLAYPARAMS.BIN can go into Alien Isolation\DATA\UI

Be aware that doing so will mean you have to really look for items, and necessity of the flashlight is amplified.

_____________________

Yet another addition I've created is a fun little amalgam of 1954's "The Black Widow" Fox intro and the classic unresolved intro made famous by Alien 3.

To make that happen, take the FOX_IDENT.USM file and drop it into Alien Isolation\DATA\UI\MOVIES.

ReShade has a habit of forgetting certain settings whenever you add a new preset. That's why you backed it up. You can cross-reference the folders and correct accordingly.

If you find any of these effects "failed to compile" in-game, check in the ReShade settings that the corresponding folder is mentioned in the "Effect Search Paths" section.

If not, find it in your File Explorer, Copy As Path, Hit + in "Effect Search Paths", then Paste into the new window.

_____________________

On that note, you may find ReShade causing some ghosting during cutscenes (as hinted at after step 6).

This is because the scenes are separate to the in-game engine, which is still working in the background.

To avoid this, on ReShade you can set a key to toggle all effects in between and including Reveil Top and Reveil Bottom.

Or toggle to NOIR 1.5 Kino. That's what I made it for.

Anecdotal: I usually have everything set on ultra and my settings on my Nvidia Control Panel set to Vertical Sync as well as the in-game setting to ensure the Nvidia's Adaptive VSync is utilised. Double tap.

I also left sharpening and chromatic aberration set to default on Alias.

Despite the ultra settings, the resolution is best reduced to 2048x1152. Any higher than this and the sharpness reaches a point of insanity which takes away from the aesthetic.

Shadow Mapping is on Standard; Contact Hardening creates unwelcome artifacts.

MAKE SURE THE FILM GRAIN INTENSITY IS SET TO ZERO, elsewise it will look awful.


A trailer using this preset can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCR6Y1IgTSQ&t

Enjoy.
