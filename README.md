# NOIR

I'm kind of up to v1.7 on my NOIR Reshade, after having messed around with some of the free RTGIs.

Nothing came close to Marty's.

I don't honestly know if there will be an update to this, despite the fact this is only the second version I've shared.

If I can solve the artifact problem ZN_LC can cause without making it too shallow, I'll definitely bring that up.

So far that effects very few aspects in-game. It's mostly the main menu and the odd cut scene.

Also note I have my visuals on Gamma 3. It depends on the brightness of your monitor, but that works for me with maximum brightness.

Enjoy.
